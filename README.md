# Wireframe Data Viewer
***Start:** August 11<sup>th</sup> 2023, **Finish:** September 5<sup>th</sup> 2023*

For a second-year course: Graphical Programming

## Scenario
This program renders a 3D triangle wireframe surface data model and allows one to rotate, scale and anti-alias the model so that it can be viewed from any direction - a simple CAD program.

**Instructions:**

To open a wireframe, click on the "File" menu, then the "Open" object. This program only works `.dat` files (error handling not implemented) - a folder of example wireframes can be found in this repository. You may proceed to toggle the sliders and buttons for your desired features (rotation, scaling, anti-aliasing). 

This was created from start-up code written by lecturer Dr. Ian Bond - It only had the JPanel features (slide and button widgets) implemented.

## What I learnt:
- Implementing a wireframe display from reading .dat files using GUI methods (and the `Wireframe` class)
- Rotation and scaling of vertices in the wireframe using matrices
- Back face culling
- Painter's Algorithm
- Anti-aliasing
